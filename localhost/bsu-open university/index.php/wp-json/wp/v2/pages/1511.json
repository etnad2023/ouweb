By filling a LOA, the student&#8217;s name will still be active in the list of OU students. Thus, he can still process necessary requirements (completion of grades, avail of services, etc.) from the OU. Note, however that the LOA is counted in the 5-year MRR.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How many units are required to finish a Degree Program in the OU?
